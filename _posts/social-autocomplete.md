# Social autocomplete – a feature for a coding environment

## The user experience

### Normal use

* I create an HTML document (it could be any language)
* I wherever I click, suggestions pop up of code that I might want to use, I recognise the suggestions from other times I’ve used the same code

### Sharing code

- I tell my friend that I need some code
- my friend pastes the code into a document
- the code is immediately available to me through the typing interface

## Benefits
