In Lion, Apple changed the default behavior for moving up and down within documents.

Apple refers to this behavior as “Scroll direction: natural”.

In HCI terms
----------------
- Windowing: user actions affect the conceptual viewport – the “window”.
Gesturing up moves the window up, the document appears to go down but is conceptually stationery. 
- Scrolling: user acting upon the content.
Gesturing up moves the content up, providing a good match between system and mental models. In other words The window conceptually stays still and actually stays still. 

With Lion Apple switched from “windowing” to scrolling. Windowing is where the user manipulates the window using scrollbars and up/down buttons to move the conveptual view to a new point in a static document
